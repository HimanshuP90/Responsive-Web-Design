					<p>HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.[6] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.</p>
					<p>It was published in October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)[2][4] to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia, while keeping it both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc.</p>
					<p>Media queries are simple filters that can be applied to CSS styles. They make it easy to change styles based on the characteristics of the device rendering the content, including the display type, width, height, orientation, and even resolution</p>
					<p>Media queries enable us to create a responsive experience where specific styles are applied to small screens, large screens, and anywhere in between. The media query syntax allows for the creation of rules that can be applied depending on device characteristics</p>

					<p>Since screen dimensions and width in CSS pixels vary widely between devices (for example, between phones and tablets, and even between different phones), content should not rely on a particular viewport width to render well.

					<p><strong>Responsive web design </strong> is an approach to web design which makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Recent work also considers the viewer proximity as part of the viewing context as an extension for RWD</p>
					<p>Responsive design allows your website to adapt to the device your users are viewing it on. It provides you with the capability to write once publish everywhere, meaning less work for you</p>
					<p>The reasons you should move across to responsive design continues to grow. It saves you time, it saves you money, and best of all enables your user to access your content the way they love</p>
					<p>Responsive design can be achieved in three simple steps. A flexible grid-based layout, enable flexible media, and finally the addition of media queries</p>

			<h2>Set the viewport</h2>
			<p>Pages optimized for a variety of devices must include a meta viewport tag in the head of the document.</p>
			<P>A meta viewport tag gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling</p>
			<p>Let's start by optimizing the small screen layout. In this case, let's boost the font when the viewport width is greater than 360px. Second, when there is enough space</p>

			<h2>Size Content</h2>
			<p>A key concept behind responsive design is fluidity and proportionality as opposed to fixed width layouts. </p>
			<p>Using relative units for measurements can help simplify layouts and prevent accidental creation of components that are too big for the viewport.</p>

			<h2>Breakpoints ..?</h2>
			<p>Don't define breakpoints based on device classes. Defining breakpoints based on specific devices, products, brand names, or operating systems that are in use.</p>
			<p>Today can result in a maintenance nightmare. Instead, the content itself should determine how the layout adjusts to its container.</p>
